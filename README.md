# Running with R
:page_with_curl: This repo is currently aimed at providing quick help for myself when I get stuck using R

:page_with_curl: The sources are pooled from various learning tutorials, blogs, courses, discussions, friendly chats etc. Some are from my own experiments

:page_with_curl:This would always be a work in progress and never complete
